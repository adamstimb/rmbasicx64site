## It's a what now?

RM BASICx64 is a re-implementation the RM Basic language developed by Research Machines in 1984 for the RM Nimbus PC-186.  RM BASICx64 looks and behaves like the original, but under the  hood it takes full advantage of modern computer architectures by supporting 64 bit floating point numbers, extremely deep expression evaluation, and vast amounts of workspace memory.

## Project status

The current release is very far from a complete implementation of RM Basic.  Before rushing to install please see the [release notes](docs/releases.html) to manage your expectations.

RM BASICx64 was written in [Go](https://golang.org/) by Tim Adams, leaning heavily on the [ebiten](https://ebiten.org/) game engine, and borrowing with merry abandon from [Writing An Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball.
